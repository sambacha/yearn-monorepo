### How to bond:

- to add bonds you need to call (bond) with as much ETH (msg.value) as you'd like to bond.
    - check amount being bonded is higher than the penalty of the job you want to perform work on

- call `enableStealthContract(address _contract)` with `_contract` being the address of the contract you want to perform work on
    - in this case `0x0a61c2146A7800bdC278833F21EBf56Cd660EE2a` (YearnStealthRelayer)
    - you can also use `enableStealthContracts(address[] calldata _contracts)`
    - this is required since contracts have the ability to take your bond away.
        - so, please be careful and only enable contracts after reviewing them.

- to remove a contract from your list just call `disableStealthContract(address _contract)`
    - you can also use `disableStealthContracts(address[] calldata _contracts)`

- to unbond, call (startUnbond), wait 4 days, and call (unbond | unbondAll).
    - in this period you'll not be able to perform any work
    - to cancel unbond and continue working call (cancelUnbond)

### How to work:

- here is an example on how to call a job though `StealthRelayer`:
```ts
    // First, grab the data for the underlying tx
    const rawTx = await stealthERC20.connect(alice).populateTransaction.stealthMint(alice.address, mintAmount);
    const callData = rawTx.data;

    // then generate a random string and compact it into 32 bytes
    const stealthHash = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(['string'], ['random-secret-hash']);
    // then get the block number (useful for bandit attack protection)
    let blockNumber = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
    const pendingBlock = await ethers.provider.send("eth_getBlockByNumber", ["latest", false])
    const blockGasLimit = BigNumber.from(pendingBlock.gasLimit);

    // and finally execute your tx. (this step can be changed to use flashbots, see guide below)
    // [Important] If you do NOT use flashbots, make sure to be using a private-mempool, such as Taichi, or you'll lose your bond.
    await stealthRelayer.connect(alice).execute(
      stealthERC20.address, // address _job,
      callData, // bytes memory _callData,
      stealthHash, // bytes32 _stealthHash,
      blockNumber + 2, // uint256 _blockNumber
      { gasLimit: blockGasLimit.sub(15_000) } // 15k should be more than enough to cover for block's gasLimit reduction
    );
```

### Risks:

- at any point in time governance can take your bond away.
- if the private mempool service you were using leaks your tx, you can get your bond slashed.
    - you still might be able to recover up to 90% of the penalty if there was no harm done.


### Requirements:

- interacting with the StealthRelayer **MUST ALWAYS** be done using an EOA.
    - failure to comply with this requirement will result in instant and unreversable slashing of all your bond.
- [IMPORTANT] we use an EOA check that requires you to set the tx's gas as close to `block.gaslimit` as possible.
    - there is a buffer of ~36192 gas units, this can be increased or decreased, but it's there to give you a little room and make sure you can send txs with a bit less of the current max block.gasLimit

- we suggest you use Flashbots to avoid getting charged on reverted txs, but you can use whatever private mempool service you desire.
    - here is a [sample script for goerli](https://github.com/lbertenasco/bonded-stealth-tx/blob/main/scripts/flashbots/02-goerli-send-tx.ts)
    - [IMPORTANT] take into account that if we see any abuse or irregular activity, i.e. tx-sandwiching, you might lose both your StealthVault and Keep3r bonds.

### Being a watcher:

Being a watcher for the StealthRelayer implies you need to constantly monitor mempool transactions, and report any public tx you might see that will earn you a percentage of the keeper bond.

view bonded-stealth-txs script for sample code. [yearn sample watcher script](https://github.com/lbertenasco/bonded-stealth-tx/blob/main/scripts/watcher/yearn.ts)


### Reporting errors

To report errors, bugs or security concerns you can reach us at Yearn's discord server, under the Keep3r channel.
For security concerns/exploits please raise the issue without disclosing the details, and we'll get in touch with you over the discord channel so we can establish a secure line of communication. Bounty rewards will be assigned to you for your work.

### Disputing slashing

If you feel you have been mistakenly slashed please reach to us over yearn's discord server or though yearn's keep3r forum.
Remember 10% of your slashed bond will not be refunded, since it was used to reward the watcher who reported the tx-hash.

In some cases even if you got slashed while acting in good faith, and the underlying job was not harmed, you can get up to 90% of the penalty back.

In the other hand, if you are a job, and your protocol got affected by a keeper, you can present evidence and ask though discord to slash the keeper bonds (on Keep3r and/or StealthVault)
